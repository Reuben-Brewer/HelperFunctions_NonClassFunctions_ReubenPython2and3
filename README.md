# HelperFunctions_NonClassFunctions_ReubenPython2and3
Various Python functions that "help" in my larger classes. Many of these functions appear in my other repositories, and I'm slowly updating those repositories to call these "helper" files so that it's easier to keep all repositories synchronized with the same helper-function-code (instead of duplicating the same code in each class). "HelperFunctions_NonClassFunctions_ReubenPython2and3.py" contains functions that can be called outside of a class (and passed a "globals()" global variables argument).
